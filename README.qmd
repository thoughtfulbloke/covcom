This is where I will be making my notes, thinking and support evidence for my submission to the 2nd NZ covid commission https://haveyoursay.covid19lessons.royalcommission.nz

The country has already had one enquiry, available at https://www.covid19lessons.royalcommission.nz/reports-lessons-learned/ but the present government is not going to act on any of the recommendations until next year, when it has the report organised by the political party on record as saying "When it came to COVID, we completely blew out what the value of a life was" as well. This is the second covid enquiry.

I know, from comments in hate mail directed at me, the fringe anti-vax supporters of minor, but at present disproportionately influential, political parties consider this to be "their" enquiry that will validate their claims and beliefs.

Even, if it does so, I am still determined that my contribution (and all contributions that do not request privacy will be public) will make it clear that there are those within the country prepared to advocate for an approach that is both fact based and caring for others. History can be the judge about the the commission final report. So my authorial persona is "making a good faith effort to make useful comments, while countering absurdities I expect are appearing in other submissions"

## Submission

I am a New Zealand Citizen who was present continuously in the country for the entirety of the acute covid period of 2020 to 2022 inclusive, where the acute covid period is where worldwide there were death rates significantly above historical pre-pandemic trends.

For the stated goal of the commission being "We will be using our review of these key decisions to give advice to the Government on how Aotearoa New Zealand could prepare for and respond to any future pandemics" there are a couple of general assumptions I am making in my comments.

The first is that for preparing and responding to any future pandemics, the possible options will be constrained by the legally binding W.H.O. pandemic treaty that New Zealand has been a party to drafting. For example, New Zealand cannot expect to have preferential access to vaccines in the future (where preferential is obtaining a disproportionate number of vaccines to keep the NZ population safer and enable earlier return to normality at a cost of unvaccinated mass death in other countries). So, to me, it is a bit pointless making claims that New Zealand should aim to preferentially obtained vaccine supplies in future pandemics.

The second assumption is that we do not, based on the experience of the last pandemic, know the deadliness of any future pandemics. Nor, at the start of any future pandemic is the death toll understood, as it will vary with things like time to develop vaccines and implement full vaccine cover. So any recommendations should be broadly applicable to a range of pandemics rather than focusing on a specific, idiosyncratic, measure of the way the last pandemic evolved.

The third assumption I am making is that in decided the wisdom of actions at a time of world-wide pandemic, evidence and context matter. Something that future historians reading these submission need to be aware of is that approximate 1% of the population does not believe virus exist and/or cause disease. A time of mass death due to a viral epidemic causes a fundamental disagreement between the vast bulk of the population that accept the last 120 years of biology versus the small minority that do not. In evidence of causes, and claims of appropriate actions to address those causes, evidence which ignores the effects of the pandemic and ascribes all harms to actions in response to it are disproportionately created by the 1% of the population who do not contemporary biology. Those studying the corpus of submissions and finding those at strong variance to biology can simply search for author's public statements about doubts around the existence or actions of viruses.

This creates a fundamental conflict in pandemic response, with almost all of the population not wanting their risk from pandemic damage increased by their response to the pandemic being constrained by people not accepting twentieth century biology, and the 1% not wanting the country they live in to act in ways that are contrary to their beliefs.

These radically different views of what are evidence show up particular in the case of pandemic deaths and vaccines, as these are particularly connected to the science of the last 120 years of biology. For the last few centuries actuaries and others have understood that comparing deaths should be done on the basis of comparing deaths rates (so as not to confuse having more or fewer people with changes in risk) by age (so as not to confuse changes in the number of older or younger people with different risks of death). The tens of thousands of excess deaths claimed by antivaxers, and so being used as a justification for anti-vaxer actions, is simply the result of ignore the growing number of elderly people who have a higher risk of dying naturally than younger people, and ascribing all those natural deaths to vaccines. For more details about this see https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/09/06/the-truth-about-nzs-death-rate-that-covid-commission-will-hear/

That there is a conflict between this minority and the rest of society at pandemic times is not surprising. However, the existence this inevitable conflict is, in itself, not a reason to accept dodgy maths as valid evidence for concluding what the problem is and what the solutions may be. The truth between peer reviewed science developed over centuries and oppositional beliefs of extreme minorities opposed to that does not lie half way in between.

For the acute phase of the covid pandemic, we can use actuarial methods of the last few centuries to compare deaths in groups of countries with similar characteristics, and include economic measures.

By comparison with other countries, we can make a series of general observations. Such as:

- The pandemic was a serious worldwide crisis, that did the most damage in countries with low acceptance of vaccination.
- The overall health system created some potential to save lives, and if New Zealand was prepared to tax and fund health to a level 1.5 times what it did prior to the pandemic, it could have kept some people alive with treatment that would otherwise not be.
- 2021, with the the deadly Delta strain (comparatively deadly particularly compared to the subsequent Omicron strain) was the year many countries peaked in deaths as they relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions without yet having full population immunity from repeated vaccination.

While peak unemployment is shown as an indicator (and New Zealand peaked low), if one takes a concept like "years of life lost" for a population, and uses the statistical value of a life developed by the New Zealand Ministry of Transport, those indicators show that in the time of international pandemic no other country was able to save as many lives for cheaper.

The first phase of the COVID-19 Inquiry ran until 28 November 2024, including a public submissions period in early 2024. Phase Two of the Inquiry is now underway. Phase Two is looking at some additional topics that were not covered in Phase One, as well as looking in more detail at some of the topics included in Phase One, such as mandates and lockdowns.

### Vaccines, including mandates, approvals,

For my personal experience, my mother is still alive, unlike elderly relatives of friends in other countries. Nor was I hospitalised needing critical care for covid, unlike people I went to school with who were living overseas at the time. In fact, I personally have no close acquaintances hospitalised for covid in NZ. Most of the people I know living overseas with a similarly aged social sphere do know pre-vaccination people with their lives disrupted by infection.

As someone who read the publicly available scientific advice at the time in 2021, I have read people more recently misstating what that advice was, then saying that their mis-statement of that advice meant that the government had lied to them. The official scientific advice of the New Zealand Government as of May 7th 2021 (so when many of the specific roll-out plans were being implemented) is still available stored in the Internet Archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20210623233231/https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/science_updates_7_may_2021.pdf#expand the gist of understanding about vaccines at the time was (and still is) that:

- vaccines lowered spread, not prevent it entirely
- vaccines lowered the risk of serious illness and death, not prevent it entirely.

This understanding was matched by the age standardised mortality rates in other countries, where more vaccination matches fewer deaths.

On the specific topic of mandates, I am of the opinion that at a time of an infectious disease pandemic, the state has a special responsibility to minimise the risk to life of people at times those people are required (by health necessity or legal requirement) to physically interact with agents of the state. And I feel, as a non-lawyer, that the vibe of the Bill of Rights Act stuff about not being deprived of life is consistent with that. As the covid vaccine was both safe (for which I will spell out the evidence) and effective (spelling out the 2021 evidence on reducing transmission, and the 2022 Omicron era evidence because they were different levels of reducing transmission) at reducing onward transmission (also making the point here that many critics are falsely conflating does not perfectly counter every infection with has no effect at all), agents of the state rejecting being part of mandates are wanting to exercise their state mandated power in a way more risky to others. 

For vaccine approvals for use, as a starting point any decision should be based on the best scientific evidence at the time. But any recommendations made by the commission should be based on the two major changes since the assessment of vaccines in the last pandemic.

Firstly, that the W.H.O. pandemic treaty just negotiated by New Zealand is expected to make vaccine access fairer for the world as a whole, so mean less preferential access for wealthy countries.

Secondly, the changes that have been made to Medsafe approvals process of accepting evidence used in successful approvals in comparable jurisdictions. This is expected to speed up the approval process for globally in demand medicines.  

To achieve the Commission objective of advising and preparing for future pandemics, any recommendations should be from the starting point of the time of issue of the Commission's report rather than the time under consideration.

### Safety Lockdowns, particularly the lockdowns of late 2021 and the extended Auckland/Northland lockdown

In a pandemic generated by a novel pathogen, there is no more effective way of not catching, spreading, or being damaged by the pathogen than not being where it is. Every other mechanism that involves lowering risk in an environment of exposures involves more risk than not being exposed.

While few people enjoy safety lockdowns, any recommendations that involve removing them as a possibility (given unknown levels of future pandemic deadliness) should involve a bundle of alternatives that provide equivalent protection for a population. These alternatives need to be funded to be prepared for as rapid introduction in emergency situations as lockdowns can be.

I would suggest that as the purpose of safety lockdowns is to separate infected individuals from infectable individuals during a diseases infectious period, the easiest place to develop equivalent response potential is in the public health contact tracing area, where funding more detailed knowledge of infectious chains would support a move from broader to more targeted interventions to prevent pathogen spread.

If the Commission is assessing forms of "cost" of lockdowns and using that for a decision making basis, then for future planning I suggest that any recommendations need to include the mechanism for developing a way of measuring that cost when it is not yet known because it is too early in the pandemic cycle. Such mechanisms also need to be able to distinguish the cost of the pandemic from the cost of interventions. For example while New Zealand saw health treatment delays and economic costs, those delays and costs were less than countries with more spread of covid because the disease itself has a cost.

### Testing and tracing technologies, like RAT tests

RAT tests were an example of the widespread introduction of a new technology that more exactly and specifically determine infectiousness, and so enabled more exact targeting of public health measures.

At times of future pandemic, it seems reasonable to have ready availability of any technologies of the day that permit more exact targeting of public health measures.

But the more individualised the application of such technologies, the more there needs to be good, accurate, public information on how such technologies work and what they determine. Since there is no expert in the process, the public needs the relevant information.

My personal experience was I was comfortable visiting my elderly mother in person, maintaining those social bonds, knowing I was not placing my mother at risk of death through my actions.

### The COVID-19 Tracer app

New Zealand's covid tracer app was a triumph of opt-in, privacy preserving, low cost technical response. Compared to the abject failures of such implementations in many other countries, I suggest there are many positive lessons to ponder about the development of such technology in a way that is effective for individuals and the country.

### Public health materials, like masks.

Because masks work as an engineering solution to a dangerous particle size problem, consideration of masks is very similar to workplace health requirements. A given quality of mask creates a barrier to a dangerous particle of a particular size, so long as the mask is worn in an exposure environment.

I feel that because New Zealand kept covid from spreading by macro-methods, in the last pandemic thorough public understanding of factual information around the relationship between mask quality and exposure environments was lacking.

If a future respiratory pandemic is going to be mitigated by the collective masking of individuals, then those individuals need accurate understanding of the context of use.
